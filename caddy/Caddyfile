# Main Caddyfile - Imports configurations

# Optional: Global options block
# {
#   email your-email@example.com # Set your email for Let's Encrypt (if using real domains)
#   acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory # Use staging LE for testing
# }

# Import reusable snippets first (so they are defined before being used)
import snippets/*.caddy

# Import all site configurations from the sites directory
import sites/*.caddy

# You can add other global directives here if needed, outside of site blocks.
